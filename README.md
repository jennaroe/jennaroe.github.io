           A volunteer crisis corps that would be a hub for volunteer opportunities and information during a city-wide crisis such as a natural disaster or a mass shooting. Members would be able to track the volunteer activities available, join said activities, find contact information, track them on their calendars and receive notifications based on their preferences. 

           It is a web application using a tech stack including React, Node, Express and Postgres SQL at the moment. We will use Twilio to send text message alerts to our members during crisis mode. The mobile application will come in our second phase, but the plan is to start on the iPhone application. Our team consists of 4 web developers and we plan to build the website, server and API ourselves.

**Changing the colour of the theme**

Every colour variant has its appropriate stylesheets located in the /css directory. To change the colour of the template simply change the path in the header of the HTML template, i.e. from *style.default.css* to *style.pink.css*.


**Javascript**

Apart from Bootstrap JS components majority of JS is located in /js/front.js. In this file you can change the settings of the owl carousel, google maps settings etc. 

**Google Maps**

Google maps are used on the contact page. If you need just to show location of the company on the map, the only neccessary thing is to change coordinates in the header of contact.html. For further settings and possibilities please consult [Google Maps API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/).

**Contact form**

To set up contact form:

1. Upload a template to your webhosting or set up HTTP server on your local machine (XAMPP, WAMP or similar).
2. Make directory php/temp writeable (change attributes to 777)
3. Edit the options in contact.php file. The most important are: `$from` and `$sendTo`. The rest can remain as it is.
